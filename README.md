# WordPress Plugin RSS Synchronisation

The WordPress Plugin RSS Sync is able to read external RSS feeds, process them, and insert the data into WP Posts.

It is highly configurable, just go to the settings page and define what feeds you want to read and how often, among other things. It then launches a cron job for you.
